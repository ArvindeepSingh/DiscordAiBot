# Discord AI Chatbot

This Discord bot integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide real-time, AI-powered responses to user queries. The bot is built using Python and Discord.py and supports asynchronous interaction in Discord servers.

## Features
- **AI Responses**: Users can ask questions using the `!askAI` command, and the bot will provide answers powered by OpenAI's GPT-4.
- **Command Parsing**: Custom command (`!askAI`) to handle user queries.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures stability by managing API limits and user input errors.
